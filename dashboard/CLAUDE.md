## Modularity rules — feature-sliced architecture

The dashboard is organized by **feature**, not by technical layer. Each
folder under `features/` is a self-contained vertical slice:

- All UI for that feature
- Local state (if any)
- Feature-specific hooks
- A single `index.ts` exporting the public surface (usually just the page)

Rules:
- A feature MAY import from `api/`, `hooks/`, `components/`, `lib/`, `types/`.
- A feature MUST NOT import from another feature's internals. If two features
  need the same piece, lift it into `components/shared/` or `lib/`.
- Adding a feature = adding a folder + adding a route. Removing = deleting
  the folder + removing the route. No other code touched.

## API client layer

- `api/client.ts` is the only place axios is configured
- Each resource file exports typed functions returning Promises (no React there)
- Hooks in `hooks/` wrap those functions in `useQuery`/`useMutation`
- Components never call axios directly. They use hooks.

## Configuration

A web app runs in the browser, so "env vars" mean two things:

1. **Build-time** (Vite `VITE_*` vars): baked into the JS bundle at build.
   Use for things that never change per deployment (e.g., feature toggles
   for the build).
2. **Runtime** (injected by Caddy at request time via a template, or fetched
   from `/api/config` endpoint on app boot): use for anything that differs
   per environment (API base URL, plant name, etc.).

Pattern: `src/config.ts` reads from `window.__APP_CONFIG__`, populated by an
inline `<script>` Caddy generates at request time. This means one built image
deploys to dev, staging, and prod with no rebuild.

## Feature flags

- Server exposes `/api/feature-flags` returning the current map
- Dashboard fetches on app boot, caches in TanStack Query with 5 min staleness
- `useFlag("flag_name")` hook in `lib/feature-flags.ts` returns bool
- Use to hide unfinished UI from production or A/B test new flows

## Data model notes (ADR-013)

Products are the top-level configuration entity. Defect types only exist
inside a product context — there is no global defect-type list. The two
categories (`PMP`, `INJECTION`) are plant-wide constants; their display
names (`"PMP Défauts"`, `"Injection Défauts"`) are fetched from
`GET /constants/categories` and must never be hardcoded in component
source. New pages needed (not yet built):

- `ProductsPage` — list all products, create/archive
- `ProductDetailPage` — manage one product's defect types in both
  categories, showing the 12-cap counter per category

The `defect-types/` feature folder is replaced by `products/` and
`product-detail/`. There is no standalone defect-types page.

## UI rules

- Defect type editor must show the 12-per-category cap as a visible
  counter per `(product, category)` and disable "Add" at 12.
  The `is_other_fallback` type does not count toward the cap and must
  be rendered as undeletable (no delete button or button is greyed out).
- Category labels come from `GET /constants/categories` via a hook —
  never hardcode `"PMP Défauts"` or `"Injection Défauts"` in JSX.
- After a defect mutation, show a "syncing to devices" indicator that
  resolves when the server confirms the MQTT publish (server returns
  config version, device status endpoint shows which devices have that
  version)
- Default filter on Logs page = last 7 days
- Devices page polls every 10s for live online/offline status
- All forms use `react-hook-form` + `zodResolver`. Schemas in `lib/schemas/`
- Server state in TanStack Query, NOT in component state or Redux
- Toasts (sonner) for mutation feedback. No `alert()` ever

## Containerization

Multi-stage Dockerfile:
- `builder`: node:20-alpine, runs `pnpm install` then `pnpm build`
- `runtime`: `caddy:2-alpine`, copies `/dist` from builder, custom Caddyfile

Runtime Caddy:
- Serves SPA with fallback to `/index.html`
- Reverse-proxies `/api/*` to the server container by service name (no
  hardcoded IP)
- Injects runtime config into a `/config.js` endpoint from env vars
- Listens on 80 (TLS terminated by the upstream Caddy in `infra/`)

Must build for `linux/arm64`.

## Testing

- Vitest + React Testing Library
- One test per page rendering happy path. Don't chase coverage on UI.
- Mock the API client at the axios level using MSW
- Each feature's tests live next to its code in `features/<name>/__tests__/`

## Environment Variables (runtime)

- `API_BASE_URL` (injected into `window.__APP_CONFIG__`)
- `PLANT_NAME` (display string, e.g. "Tunis Plant 1")
- `LOCALE` (e.g. "fr-TN")
- `FEATURE_FLAG_OVERRIDES` (optional, JSON object for dev)
